# Image Steganography using MATLAB

Implement Plus-Mius One (PM1) and DCT-DWT Image Steganography techniques for embedding an image within an image.

PM1 : Genetic Algorithm to optimize the quality loss of the host image.
DCT-DWT : Embed image data in least significant bits of DCT-DWT transformation of host image.
